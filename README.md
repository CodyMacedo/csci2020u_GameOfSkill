# csci2020u_GameOfSkill
CSCI2020U Final Project

To run this program, download this repository as a .zip. 
Extract th zip and open the folder using an IDE such as IntelliJ. 
Compile all .java files and run the GameOfSkillServer.java.
Once the server file is running, run Main.java. 

We encountered a problem when you finish the game, the game would freeze until you stop the server.java
Cody fixed the server problem but a little past the due date. i don't know if this is okay or not.
So I pushed the changes just in case.
Cody sent me the code since he has issues with his IntelliJ running and github syncing and I 
pushed his changes. The latest changes to the server are done by Cody.
